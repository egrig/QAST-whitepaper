# **QAST: A Decentralized Protocol for Software Quality Assurance**

## **Abstract**

QAST proposes a decentralized platform to incentivize and validate software quality assurance processes using blockchain technology. By combining on-chain bounties, off-chain testing tools, and crypto-economic incentives, QAST aims to become the global protocol for storing and verifying QA efforts, bugs, audits, and automated testing metadata.

## **Introduction**

Despite the critical importance of software testing, QA remains underfunded, undervalued, and largely off-chain. Projects suffer security breaches, user experience failures, and lost revenue due to bugs that could have been caught with community-powered, incentivized QA. QAST offers a framework to decentralize and amplify QA by leveraging blockchain primitives and AI-powered agents.

## **Protocol Overview**

QAST connects developers, testers, security researchers, and automated QA agents through:

* **Bounty Contracts**: Developers stake tokens to fund QA campaigns.  
* **QA Contributions**: Testers submit bug reports, test cases, and logs.  
* **Reputation System**: Validators score contributions using on-chain logic.  
* **Verification Oracles**: AI agents and human validators assess quality.  
* **Record Layer**: Immutable storage of test artifacts, audits, and scan results.

## **Consensus Mechanism**

QAST operates atop a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain (Polygon or equivalent) using delegated validation.

* **QA Validators** stake tokens and earn fees for verifying results.  
* **Challenges** allow for dispute resolution and slashing for bad actors.

## **Token Model**

* **QAST Token** ($QAST): Utility token for bounties, staking, voting.  
* **Use Cases**:  
  * Paying for QA work  
  * Staking to become a validator  
  * Voting on disputes and roadmap  
  * Incentivizing automation agents

## **Governance**

QAST will use progressive decentralization:

* Early multisig team control  
* DAO governance via $QAST token after mainnet  
* Treasury management, protocol upgrades, ecosystem grants

## **Technical Architecture**

* **Smart Contracts**: Manage bounties, reputation, disputes  
* **Off-chain QA Agents**: Upload evidence and structured test data  
* **AI Verifiers**: NLP models classify bugs, severity, duplicates  
* **On-chain Anchoring**: All reports timestamped immutably  
* **IPFS/Arweave**: For storing artifacts like test logs, video evidence

## **Use Cases**

* Community-sourced testing for DeFi dApps, NFTs, L2s  
* Automation agents that validate smart contract behavior  
* QA as an on-chain service for Web2 companies  
* Storage of security scan results (SAST/DAST output)  
* Anchor audit results immutably  
* Public trail of bug bounty history

## **Extended Vision: Blockchain of Record for QA/Security**

Beyond bounties, QAST can evolve into the **default public ledger for software testing, audits, and security assessments**, offering:

* Certifiable compliance traces  
* Developer trust signals  
* Persistent QA reputations across projects  
* Open plugin architecture for test runners

## **Market Potential**

* **Software testing market**: \~$60B annually (Gartner)  
* **Bug bounty market**: Growing \~20% YoY  
* **Smart contract audits**: \~$500M/year (Chainalysis)  
* **Developer tooling**: Multi-billion dollar SaaS sector

If QAST captures just 0.5% of this spend, that represents **$300M+ annual protocol flow**, with upside in Layer 2s, AI testing tools, and supply-chain QA.

## **Risks and Mitigation**

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ----- | ----- |
| Low QA quality / spam | AI filters, staking slashing, peer review |
| Collusion in validations | Randomized review pools, dispute bonding |
| Adoption resistance | Focus on web3-native projects first |
| Legal gray areas | Design as tooling, not employment |
| High dev uplift | Offer SDKs and no-code submission tools |

## **Forward-Looking Vision**

As AI agents become more capable, QAST will allow fully autonomous test generation and validation to earn rewards, creating a living, learning QA ecosystem. The network could become the preferred QA backend for new blockchain applications, embedded devices, and even autonomous vehicles.

By recording QA effort on-chain, QAST ensures transparency, trust, and longevity for one of the most critical—and neglected—steps in software development.

## **Conclusion**

QAST aims to decentralize QA with smart incentives and public validation. It will serve as both a market for quality assurance and a permanent, verifiable ledger of testing outcomes. With the right support, QAST can shape the future of reliable software in web3 and beyond.
