# QAST: A Blockchain-Based Trust Layer for Quality Assurance

---

## Abstract

QAST (Quality Assurance Smart Testing) proposes a blockchain-based framework to establish verifiable, immutable records of software quality assurance activities. The primary goal is to increase transparency, accountability, and trust in software releases—especially in Web3 environments where auditability and user confidence are critical.

QAST does not aim to execute testing itself on-chain but rather acts as a **proof-of-quality registry**, where key QA artifacts, such as test results, audit certifications, and security reports, are securely timestamped, hashed, and stored for future validation.

---

## Problem Statement

In both Web2 and Web3, trust in a system's security and reliability is often opaque. Even audited protocols or tested applications fail, and users have no easy way to verify what quality practices were followed. Today’s QA processes are siloed, unverifiable by end users, and often unverifiable even by partners or auditors.

This lack of transparency is especially risky for:

- Smart contract deployments  
- Decentralized finance protocols  
- DAO governance software  
- Regulated enterprise blockchain systems  

---

## Proposed Solution

QAST proposes a decentralized registry of test evidence and quality verification, providing:

- **On-chain attestations** of QA practices  
- **Immutable timestamps** of test execution, code coverage reports, and audit results  
- **Third-party verifier support**, such as auditors, compliance officers, or trusted testing agents  
- A standard for **software release certification** (e.g., "QA Passed - Level 3")

The core function is *not* to execute tests, but to publish **verifiable metadata** and proofs about the test and audit processes:

- Who tested what  
- When  
- Under what scope or standard  

---

## Use Cases

- **Smart Contract Release Verification**: Teams can post the hash of a security audit and coverage report at the time of contract deployment.  
- **Audit Result Storage**: Verifiable evidence of completed third-party audits.  
- **Security Scan Recordkeeping**: Immutable logs of static or dynamic analysis.  
- **CI/CD Attestation**: Verification that builds passed a certain test suite before being pushed to production.  

---

## System Architecture (Simplified Overview)

- **Developers/Testers** submit QA artifacts (off-chain)  
- **Hashes of these artifacts** (e.g., JSON test reports, PDFs, audit logs) are uploaded to a smart contract  
- Metadata includes:
  - Test suite identifier  
  - Coverage percentage  
  - Auditor or agent address  
  - Timestamp  
- **IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave** used to store full documents  
- Users or regulators can **verify the artifacts by matching hashes**  

---

## Consensus and Verification

QAST uses the consensus mechanism of the underlying blockchain (e.g., Polygon PoS or zkEVM) to anchor test data.

Additional validators may be introduced in the future for attestation validity (e.g., known auditors, bounty platforms).

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                             | Mitigation                                                |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of adoption by devs/testers | Partner with audit firms, DAOs, bug bounty orgs           |
| Cold start problem               | Offer incentives for early validators and data providers  |
| Privacy concerns                 | Use metadata and hashes only; do not store raw data on-chain |
| Cost of storage                  | Use off-chain decentralized storage; optimize data format |
| Fragmentation                    | Define a minimal viable schema standard to reduce friction |

## Market Potential

The market for blockchain security, audits, and compliance tooling is growing rapidly. Potential sectors:

- $300B+ smart contract TVL (Total Value Locked)  
- $20B/year enterprise software QA market  
- Thousands of new dApps launched annually across EVM chains  
- Emerging demand for real-time regulatory compliance in DeFi  

QAST could become the **“proof-of-testing layer”** for ecosystems that currently rely on trust, spreadsheets, or audit PDFs.

---

## Forward-Looking Vision

While the initial use case focuses on **QA transparency**, QAST can evolve into a full **compliance and quality verification registry** for:

- AI safety tests  
- IoT firmware updates  
- Industrial systems and medical software  
- Software attestations under frameworks like SOC2, ISO 27001  

In a world where **Web3, AI, and decentralized platforms must earn user trust**, QAST positions itself as the **trust layer for software quality**.

Future modules may include:

- Automated scoring via AI agents  
- Interoperability with GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and third-party auditors  
- Oracle integration for off-chain test verification  
- Incentivized validator networks  

---

## Conclusion

QAST lays the foundation for a decentralized registry of software quality data. It does not aim to compete with testing tools but instead adds **trust and traceability** to their outputs. With its narrow but essential focus, it fills a critical gap in the blockchain ecosystem.
